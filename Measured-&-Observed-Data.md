## Sections
 
**Estonia EPC Assessment:** A GeoPackage linking residential building footprints with thermal statistics (Winter/Summer LST from Landsat 8-9 and SDGSAT) and EPC ratings (High A-D vs. Low E-H) sourced from the Estonian Building Registry (e-ehitus). This is paired with a zip archive of cropped orthophotos derived from the Estonian Land Board (Maa-amet) geoportal.

**Estonia PV Detection:** A dataset for photovoltaic detection containing 320x320 TIF images of residential rooftops derived from Estonian Land Board orthophotos (Maa-amet geoportal), accompanied by a GeoPackage with identified PV panel geometries.

**Ferrara Thermal Analysis:** A GeoPackage merging building characteristics (age, use) with features derived from high-resolution aerial thermal imagery provided by the Municipality of Ferrara (Comune di Ferrara Open Data).
