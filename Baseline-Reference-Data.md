## Introduction
 
Compiled datasets describing the building stock, technologies, climate indicators, and typical energy use are updated infrequently and used as the platform’s starting point.

## Sections
 
**Building stock:** This data describes the building stock of the 27 EU Member States. The buildings of each Member State are categorized into the following sets and subsets:
* Residential buildings
> * Single-family-terraced houses
> * Multifamily houses
> * Apartment blocks
*Service buildings
> * Offices
> * Trade
> * Education
> * Health
> * Hotels and restaurants
> * Other non-residential buildings

For all of these building categories, 7 age classes are considered:
* Before 1945
* 1945 – 1969
* 1970 – 1979
* 1980 – 1989 
* 1990 – 1999
* 2000 – 2010 
* 2011 – 2023

Each set of buildings (for example: Austria, Multifamily houses built from 1970 to 1979) is described through 65 parameters encompassing their area and volume, building materials, thermal properties, and energy demand for space heating, cooling, and domestic hot water, occupation, and ownership status.

**CAPEX:** Investment cost for 10 energy renovation measures across all 27 EU Member States:
* Wall insulation
* Roof insulation
* Floor insulation
* Windows replacement
* Heat pump installation
* Condensing boiler installation
* PV system installation
* Solar thermal panels installation

**OPEX:** Will be added later
